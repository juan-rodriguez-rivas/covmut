# covmut

Covmuts is a software to build sequence-based model in order to predict the mutability of each position in protein domains. It computes both an indenpent model and a epistitatic model. The latter almost always improves the mutability prediction compared to the former.

Two different interfaces are given, covmut_sequence.py makes a prediction for a single sequence while covmut_proteome.py performs the predicition for an entire proteome.
